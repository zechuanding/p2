A package to eliminate common classes of bugs from the EECS 494 student experience.
Author : Austin Yarger (ayarger@umich.edu / austin@arborinteractive.com)

=== Purpose ===
This "EECS494Helper" package automatically makes a few tweaks to your project when you import it into your unity project.
In particular, it attempts to configure your project such that your game builds will work the exact same as the in-editor version of your game.
You are welcome to learn more about the tweaks it makes (including rationale) by viewing the source code comments within this package.

=== Usage ===
Drag-and-drop the .unitypackage file into your Assets view (typically towards the bottom of the unity editor window).
Once imported, the package will automatically make all necessary tweaks to your project, and a new EECS494Helper gameobject
should become visible in your scenes.

If any strange issues arise, contact the author using the information above.
